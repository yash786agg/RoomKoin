# RoomKoin

This application makes offline records of Birds which includes the name of the species, rarity, notes, and
timestamp. Which we are storing with the help of the Android JetPack Room Database. Code structure includes
2 Classes one is to list the data and second is used to store the bird's records. App Structure is
developed by keeping in mind that, this app can be extended to provide support for Network API calls easily.
